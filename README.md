**Satisfaction Survey**

In this project, I'm exploring the fundamental elements of customer satisfaction throughout the entire travel experience, encompassing before, during, and after flights, 
to pinpoint the factors contributing to favorable reviews. Let's uncover the secrets behind their satisfaction!

I'm working with the "airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv" dataset from Maven Analytics. This dataset consists of 129,880 entries across 24 columns. It features a single response variable, 
which is binary categorical in nature. The dataset encompasses fourteen ordinal variables derived from survey responses, four continuous variables, and four categorical variables represented as strings.

**Results of EDA:**
1) There are proportionately more unsatisfied customers than satisfied.
2) There are more female travelers than males. Gender role satisfaction to dissatisfaction proportion are not statistically much different.
3) Customer type, whether first-time or returning, significantly influences satisfaction scores, with returning customers consistently providing higher ratings.
4) Business travelers type consistently rate their satisfaction higher.
5) Business class travelers tend to rate their satisfaction higher, whereas economy class travelers tend to rate their satisfaction lower.
6) Satisfaction levels tend to increase with age.
7) Returning customers flying business class reported the highest satisfaction scores.
8) Returning customers flying economy class reported the highest dissatisfaction scores.
9) Male and female returning business customers consistently reported the highest satisfaction scores.
10) Male and female returning economy customers reported the highest dissatisfaction scores.
11) The correlation table is not a good indicator of the relationship between variables because the measures are not linear.

**What are the feautres most impacting satisfaction scores:**
